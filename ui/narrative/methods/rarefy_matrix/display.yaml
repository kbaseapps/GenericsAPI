parameters :
    input_matrix_ref :
        ui-name: |
            Input Matrix
        short-hint : |
            Input matrix whose data needs to be rarefied
        long-hint  : |
            Input matrix whose data needs to be rarefied

    new_matrix_name:
        ui-name: |
            Rarefied Matrix Name
        short-hint : |
            Output rarefied matrix name
        long-hint  : |
            Output rarefied matrix name

    dimension:
        ui-name: |
            Perform Rarefying Algorithm On
        short-hint : |
            Rarefy matrix on row or column
        long-hint  : |
            Rarefy matrix on row or column

    seed_number:
        ui-name: |
            Seed Number
        short-hint : |
            Seed Number
        long-hint  : |
            Seed Number

    subsample_size:
        ui-name: |
            Subsample Size
        short-hint: |
            Number of times to subsample each vector without replacement. 
        long-hint : |
            Number of times to subsample each vector without replacement. Default behavior (leaving field blank) is to use smallest vector sum. If any vector sum is less than the subsample size, that vector will not be rarefied and will be returned as is.

    num_rare_reps:
        ui-name: |
            Number of Times<br>To Randomly Rarefy
        short-hint: |
            Number of times to randomly rarefy input matrix with the subsampling size
        long-hint: |
            Number of times to randomly rarefy input matrix with the subsampling size

    central_tendency:
        ui-name: |
            Measure of<br>Central Tendency
        short-hint: |
            The measure of central tendency to apply to the randomly rarefied matrices by matrix position
        long-hint: |
            The measure of central tendency to apply to the randomly rarefied matrices by matrix position


parameter-groups:
    bootstrap:
        ui-name: |
            Bootstrap Options
        short-hint: |
            Rarefy with bootstrapping by randomly rarefying the input matrix multiple times with the same subsampling size, then taking the median or mean by matrix entry. Enable/disable to toggle feature
